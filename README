Can I even web?

So, NodeJS. I can get data from http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ so I don't
have to worry about storage or producing fake data, nor to implement my APIs. I
can deploy stuff on https://www.heroku.com/ and use that workflow as guidance.

I set up an account on Heroku, I got snap, I got the Heroki CLI. Got the NodeJS
sample app runningâ€¦
